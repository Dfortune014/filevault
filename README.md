# FileVault - Secure Cloud File Storage Documentation

Welcome to the FileVault documentation! This project is a comprehensive learning journey into building a secure, cloud-based file storage system using modern AWS services and best practices.

## 🎯 Project Overview

FileVault is a secure file management system designed to teach and demonstrate:
- **Infrastructure as Code** with Terraform
- **Serverless architecture** using AWS Lambda and API Gateway
- **Secure authentication** with AWS Cognito
- **Encrypted storage** with S3 and KMS
- **Role-based access control** (RBAC)
- **Modern frontend** development with React and TypeScript

### [Security Best Practices](./docs/security-best-practices.md)
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Least privilege IAM policies
- Defense in depth strategies
- Compliance considerations
- Security monitoring

### [Deployment & Operations](./docs/deployment.md)

- Troubleshooting guide
- Cleanup procedures

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Deploy Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   cd infrastructure/terraform
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

2. **Configure Frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   # Create .env file with Terraform outputs
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Access Application**
   - Frontend: `http://localhost:8080`
   - API: Check Terraform outputs for endpoint
