# Week 3 ‚Äì Backend API Development

## ‚úÖ Objectives
In Week 3, we built and secured the **backend API layer** for the Secure File Vault.  
The API is responsible for generating presigned URLs, listing files, downloading, and deleting documents stored in S3 with KMS encryption.  

Key components:
- **API Gateway (HTTP API v2)** with Cognito JWT Authorizer.
- **Lambda functions** (Upload, List, Download, Delete).
- **IAM least-privilege execution roles** per Lambda.
- **Cognito group checks inside Lambda** for defense-in-depth.
- **End-to-end tests** for Admin, Editor, and Viewer roles.
